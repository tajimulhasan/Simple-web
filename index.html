            <h3>Who am i?</h3>
            <p>My name is Archana Mishra but generally called by everyone as Gudia. I am 12 years old, read in class 7th
                standard. I am a second child of my parents and have an elder brother. I have a joint family in which my
                uncle, grandparents and cousins in the same big house. We love each other very much and closely related
                to grandparents. I have a group of friends however Sina is my best and true friend. I can share anything
                to her and she too. We read in the same school but in different sections. I like very much to tell jokes
                to my friends while being in the bus after school time.

                I have a unique family. All the members of my family are broad and open minded. They always promote me
                to do well in every field. They never pull me back instead motivate. I am very happy to get birth in
                this family. My family is cross-cultural extended family where my uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins,
                etc live together. I have great time with my family because we celebrate each festival together. I help
                other kids in family in doing their home works daily.</p>
